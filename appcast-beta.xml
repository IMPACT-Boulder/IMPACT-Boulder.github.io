            <description><![CDATA[<title>Version 3.3.0 (Build 469)</title>
<description>
	This is a beta version which probably has not been sufficiently tested.
	<ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (473):
			<ul>
				<li> Supports upcomming MacOS 15.
				<li> Filter dialog works on MacOS 12.
				<li> Minor UI tweaks.
			</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (472):
			<ul>
				<li> Fixed Target dialog.
				<li> As a fallback for MacOS 12 users, the accounts dialog has been added to the Impact menu.
			</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (471):
			<ul>
				<li> Fixed Template dialog.
				<li> Fixed Materials dialog.
				<li> Other bug fixes.
			</ul>

		<li> Version 3.3.0 (469):
			<ul>
				<li> Fixed an issue with the updater in MacOS 14.
				<li> A few bug bug fixes. 
			</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (468):
			<ul>
				<li> The method for culling waveforms with a large number of sampling points for generating plots can 
				     be selected in the Settings dialog. High mass resolution spectra need to use more computationally
				     expensive methods to preserve narrow features in plots.
				<li> Focusing lens voltages can be defined in the project setup.
				<li> Rewrote the scope data import dialog.
				<li> Tips for using the scope import dialog will be shown infrequently.
				<li> Electrodes can be added again in the instrument dialog.
				<li> Various bug fixes. 
			</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (467):
			<ul>
				<li> Uses the most recent version of PacketCrusher which is more forgiving when importing SUDA CCSDS data.
				<li> Fixes issues with the line catalog user interface introduced in one of the previous releases.
				     Line types can be copied and edited again!
				<li> Fixed issues with the interfacing for writing chemical formulas.
			</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (466):
			<ul>
				<li> On MacOS 14 the side bar is back on the right side of the app.
				<li> Fixed some minor work flow issues.
				<li> Fixed the zooming state of the accelerator data viewer.
				<li> Fixes some of the default instrument definitions.
			</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (465):
			<ul>
    		    <li> Includes the definition for the DDA instrument, ready for importing scope data generated by the EM.
    		    <li> Includes an updated CDA instrument definition.
    		    <li> Updates the conversion tables for CDA raw data.
    		    <li> The app silently recreates missing DN data for instruments which use conversion tables.
				<li> DN as y axis unit can now only be selected for appropriate instruments.
    		    <li> The Instrument dialog now saves gain stage definition changes.
    		    <li> The Instrument dialog now verifies whether an instrument family already exists.
    		    <li> Many bug fixes.
    		</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (464):
			<ul>
    		    <li> Migrated the Impact data base access dialogs to SwiftUI. With that the migration to SwiftUI is complete.
   				<li> Improved the Impact Query dialog. The dialog clearly indicates if Spice ressources must be loaded first to enable a correct conversion of the event time.
   				<li> Added a context menu to the Query dialog to enable easier builds of range constraints (e.g. time ≥ x && time ≤ y).
   				<li> Other bug fixes.
    		</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (463):
			<ul>
    		    <li> The spreadsheet editor has been merged with the CSV export file dialog.
   				<li> Other bug fixes.
    		</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (462):
    		<ul>
    		    <li> Reorganized the Import menu in the menu bar. 
    		    <li> Fixed crashes associated with file selection dialogs.
    		    <li> Other bug fixes.
    		</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (Build 460):
			<ul>
				<li> Excludes events with clipped QD feature from Grid Statistics analysis.
				<li> Includes all bug fixes in the current stable branch (3.2.6).
			</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (Build 456):
			<ul>
		    	<li> Columns of all Viewer tables can be rearranged by the user (only supported in MacOS 14 Sonoma). A right click into the column's header opens a menu for downselecting columns.
		    	<li> Includes all bug fixes in the current stable branch (3.2.4).
			</ul>
		<li> Version 3.3.0 (Build 454):
			<ul>
		    	<li> Columns of the Spectrum and Line Viewer tables can be rearranged by the user (only supported in MacOS 14 Sonoma).
		    	<li> Implemented a work around to prevent crashes when starting an import on Intel Macs. Please note that I couldn't 
		    	     test this on an Intel Mac so far.
			</ul>      
	</ul>
