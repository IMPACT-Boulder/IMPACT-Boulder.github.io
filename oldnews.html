        <h2>3/11/2015: Hydrothermal activity within Enceladus</h2>
        <section class="one_half first">
            <p>IMPACT research associate, <a href="people.html#hsu">Dr. Sean Hsu</a> is the lead author of a recent Nature paper that analyzed nanometer-sized silica particles originating from Enceladus, the geologically active moon of Saturn. Using data collected by the Cosmic Dust Analyser (CDA) aboard the Cassini spacecraft, this study provides new insights to Enceladus' subsurface ocean, including its salinity, pH, and temperature. This is also the first indication of ongoing hydrothermal activities outside the planet Earth.</p>
