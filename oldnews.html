Among the eight teams selected is the Institute for Modeling Plasmas, Atmospheres, and Cosmic Dust (IMPACT).<p>

            <p>IMPACT is an interdisciplinary program investigating the physical processes governing dusty plasmas on the moon and other airless bodies including issues necessary for ensuring human safety and long-term usability of mechanical and optical devices. Additionally, IMPACT conducts a series of interconnected experiments, which together advance a comprehensive understanding of impact-related phenomena. Areas explored include the measurement of particulate, gaseous and charged ejecta products from micrometeoroid impacts, including those onto icy targets.</p>

        <h2>4/3/2018: Dust mobilization on airless bodies</h2>
        <section class="one_half first">

Their work has shown the ability to mobilize micron-sized and larger dust grains in vacuum under a variety of plasma conditions. <!--Understanding these mechanisms provides insight into a broad range of observations including "horizon glow" and surface swirls on the Moon, dust ponding on Asteroid 433 Eros and Comet 67P, radial spokes in Saturn's rings, the unually smooth surface of Saturn's moon Atlas, and many others.--></p>

            <p>The results have been published in the Journal of Visual Experiments (JoVE), an online video journal that focuses on experimental methods as well as results.

        <h2>5/26/2015: LASP instrument chosen for NASA's Europa mission</h2>
        <section class="one_half first">
            <p>On May 26<sup>th</sup> NASA announced their selection of 9 instruments for a mission to Europa, an icy moon of Jupiter. Among the selected instruments will be the LASP-built SUrface Dust Mass Analyzer (SUDA) with IMPACT's own, <a href="people.html#kempf">Sascha Kempf</a> acting as the principle investigator. SUDA will study the composition of solid particles originating from Europa's surface.</p>
            <p>Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean capable of supporting life, providing an opportunity to search for living organisms beyond our planet. Furthermore, exploration of Europa may provide insight to the conditions necessary for the emergence of life in our solar system.</p>

        <section class="one_half first">
            <p>The 3 MV dust accelerator in the Dust Accelerator Laboratory (DAL) has detected its fastest dust grain to date. A dust grain with a charge of 0.63 fC, mass of 7.24 x 10<sup>-19</sup> kg, and radius of 37.3 nm was clocked at a speed of 61.86 km/s (or 138,377 mph).

        <h2>11/20/2013: Dr. Collette releases new book on data manipulation</h2>
        <section class="one_half first">
            <p>In his new book, "Python and HDF5: Unlocking Scientific Data", author Dr. Andrew Collette outlines effective ways to handle large data sets in HDF5 format using Python. Data analysis is an important component of scientific research and Andrew's book will help provide the framework to do so effectively and efficiently. Before coming to the University of Colorado in 2010, Andrew worked with laser-produced plasmas at the UCLA Basic Plasma Science Facility. More information regarding Andrew's book, including an interview with the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) can be found <a href="http://esipfed.org/ESIPInnovator-AndrewCollette">here</a>.</p>
