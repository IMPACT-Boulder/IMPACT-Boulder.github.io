    			<li> Fixed a bug where deleting a line in the spectrum view leads to a crash.
    			<li> Bug fixes and performance improvements.
	   		</ul>
    	<li> Version 3.2.1 (451):
			<ul>
    			<li> App is now sharing its internal reference database with the PacketAnalyzer app and the HyperSpectrum App.
    			<li> Fixed a number of issues with the Line Types Catalog and Cluster Types Catalog viewers.
	   		</ul>

	   		</ul>
        <li> Version 3.1.1 (419): 
        	<ul>
        	 	<li> Fixes an issue where the library selection did not work in the Line Type Library UI.
			 	<li> Addresses an rare issue that affected the import of damaged or incomplete accelerator scope traces.
			</ul>
    	<li> Version 3.1.0 (416): 
       		 <ul>
       		 	<li> New Impact Database account management, which moved to the Preferences dialog. Account credentials will be stored in the user's local keychain, implying that passwords only need entered at the time of the account's registration with the app. Accounts can be selected in the main menu's Impact menu.
       		 	<li> Supports Impact database version 3.4.0, which now accepts QD (accelerator) data. Ignored and locked state of mass lines are now exported to Impact DB. 
	    		<li> Impact Database action menus have been moved to stand alone menu Impact located in the main menu bar.
	    		<li> Import and Export submenues have been moved from File menu to main bar.
	    		<li> The H5 export has been significantly enhanced to allow for the reimport of H5 files. Import of H5 Spectrum archives are now possible. H5 archives starting with a LILBID group are considered to contain LILBID raw data generated by the Freie University group and will be coverted into a Spectrum project.
	        	<li> This version brings support of user-defined Python functions. Right now Python modules computing line shapes and waveform models can be called by Spectrum. Python plugins need to registered via the Preferences dialog. Because Spectrum is sandboxed, it cannot call call external programs including the Python interpreter. For this reason, a full Python 3.8 package including NumPy is bundled into the App (which explains the large increase of the app's size).
	    		<li> Impproved import of PSU data. The correlation between PSU and QD data can be analysed indepth with the new QD Detection Statistics tool.
	    		<li> New tool for visualizing the impact plasma composition as function of the impact speed, impact energy, and impact energy density.
	    		<li> Suports lastest version of SUDA instrument software. 					
	    		<li> Provides predefined IDEX and DDA instruments.
	        	<li> Improved code stability
	        	<li> Known issues:
	        		<ul>
	        			<li> Data sets containing complex large molecules are causing performance issues. This problem has been fixed in 3.2.0 (beta).
	        		</ul>
	   		</ul>	
	    <li> Version 3.0.8 (388):
            <ul>
                <li> Supports Impact database version 3.4.0
                <li> Ignored and locked state of mass lines are now exported to Impact DB. 
                <li> Fixes an issue where CDA data sets could not be merged.
             </ul>      
       	<li> Version 3.0.7 (387):
            <ul>
	            <li> Line areas can now be selected for CSV exports.
	            <li> Fixes an issue where the peak finder ignores the minimum S2N of a peak. 
	            <li> Fixes an issue where the spread sheet editor crashes after selecting a line mode.
	        </ul>      
         <li> Version 3.0.6 (386):
            <ul>
	            <li> The previous release has been built for Apple Silicon macs only. This release will run again on all macs. 
	        </ul>	     
         <li> Version 3.0.5 (385):
            <ul>
	            <li> The peak finder search range can now be changed. To the change the range, choose 
	                  Product > Project, then click Processing.
	           <li> Fixes various issues related to waveform trimming.
	        </ul>	      
         <li> Version 3.0.4 (384):
            <ul>
	            <li> Fixes an issue that caused the annoying alert introduced by the previous versions.
	        </ul>	      
        <li> Version 3.0.3 (382):
            <ul>
	            <li> Fixes an issue where sometimes multiple spectrometers of the same family with identical version numbers
	                   are stored in the app's internal database. This fixes multiple issues related to using the wrong spectrometer.
	            <li> This version can now read projects created with the current beta app version (3.1.x).
	            <li> The default query tree is now more meaningful.
	        </ul>

        <li> Version 3.1.1 (419): 
        	 <li> Fixes an issue where the library selection did not work in the Line Type Library UI.
			 <li> Addresses an rare issue that affected the import of damaged or incomplete accelerator scope traces.
    	<li> Version 3.1.0 (416): 
       		 <ul>
       		 	<li> New Impact Database account management, which moved to the Preferences dialog. Account credentials will be stored in the user's local keychain, implying that passwords only need entered at the time of the account's registration with the app. Accounts can be selected in the main menu's Impact menu.
       		 	<li> Supports Impact database version 3.4.0, which now accepts QD (accelerator) data. Ignored and locked state of mass lines are now exported to Impact DB. 
	    		<li> Impact Database action menus have been moved to stand alone menu Impact located in the main menu bar.
	    		<li> Import and Export submenues have been moved from File menu to main bar.
	    		<li> The H5 export has been significantly enhanced to allow for the reimport of H5 files. Import of H5 Spectrum archives are now possible. H5 archives starting with a LILBID group are considered to contain LILBID raw data generated by the Freie University group and will be coverted into a Spectrum project.
	        	<li> This version brings support of user-defined Python functions. Right now Python modules computing line shapes and waveform models can be called by Spectrum. Python plugins need to registered via the Preferences dialog. Because Spectrum is sandboxed, it cannot call call external programs including the Python interpreter. For this reason, a full Python 3.8 package including NumPy is bundled into the App (which explains the large increase of the app's size).
	    		<li> Impproved import of PSU data. The correlation between PSU and QD data can be analysed indepth with the new QD Detection Statistics tool.
	    		<li> New tool for visualizing the impact plasma composition as function of the impact speed, impact energy, and impact energy density.
	    		<li> Suports lastest version of SUDA instrument software. 					
	    		<li> Provides predefined IDEX and DDA instruments.
	        	<li> Improved code stability
	        	<li> Known issues:
	        		<ul>
	        			<li> Data sets containing complex large molecules are causing performance issues. This problem has been fixed in 3.2.0 (beta).
	        		</ul>
	   		</ul>	
	    <li> Version 3.0.8 (388):

             </ul>      
       	<li> Version 3.0.7 (387):
            <ul>
	            <li> Line areas can now be selected for CSV exports.
	            <li> Fixes an issue where the peak finder ignores the minimum S2N of a peak. 
	            <li> Fixes an issue where the spread sheet editor crashes after selecting a line mode.
	        </ul>      
         <li> Version 3.0.6 (386):
            <ul>
	            <li> The previous release has been built for Apple Silicon macs only. This release will run again on all macs. 
	        </ul>	     
         <li> Version 3.0.5 (385):
            <ul>
	            <li> The peak finder search range can now be changed. To the change the range, choose 
	                  Product > Project, then click Processing.

	        </ul>	      
         <li> Version 3.0.4 (384):
            <ul>
	            <li> Fixes an issue that caused the annoying alert introduced by the previous versions.
	        </ul>	      
        <li> Version 3.0.3 (382):
            <ul>
	            <li> Fixes an issue where sometimes multiple spectrometers of the same family with identical version numbers
	                   are stored in the app's internal database. This fixes multiple issues related to using the wrong spectrometer.
	            <li> This version can now read projects created with the current beta app version (3.1.x).
