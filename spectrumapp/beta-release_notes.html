<description>
	This is a beta version which probably has not been sufficiently tested.
	<ul>	    
	    <li> Version 3.1.0 (Build 388):
	    	<ul>
	    			<li> New Impact Database account management, which moved to the Preferences dialog. 
	    				   Account credentials will be stored in the user's local keychain, implying that passwords
	    				   only need entered at the time of the account's registration with the app. Accounts can 
	    				   be selected in the main menu's Impact menu.
	    		    <li> Impact Database action menus have been moved to stand alone menu Impact located 
	    		           in the main menu bar.
	    		    <li> The H5 export has been significantly enhanced to allow for the reimport of H5 files. Import 
	    		           of H5 Spectrum archives are now possible.
	    		    <li> Major parts of the app's code base have been moved to external packages to improve 
	    		           the quality and testability of the software.
	    		    <li> Many minor improvenments and bug fixes.
	    	<ul>
