<description>
	This is a beta version which probably has not been sufficiently tested.
	<ul>
        <li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 183:
        <ul>
            <li> MacOS Mojave dark mode support
    	    <li> New statistics tools for analysing ion ratios
    	    <li> Data base manager for data import
    	    <li> Improved IDL import
    	    <li> Improved sidebar inspectors
    	    <li> Improved Line type library
    	    <li> Use split views to present correlation panel
        <ul>
    	<li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 177:
    	<ul>
    		<li> Replaced Sparkle updater. Autoupdate should not stall any longer.
    	</ul>	    
     	<li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 173:
    	<ul>
    		<li> Fixed an issue where the app failed to access spice kernels if located 
    		     outside of the sandbox. To provide access to the kernels the directory 
    		     containing ALL KERNELS needs to be identified first via the preferences 
    		     dialog.
    		<li> The side bar presents Spice based event parameters.
    	    <li> Fixed a couple of bugs related to very old projects and to CDA data.   
    	</ul>	    
    	<li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 172:
    	<ul>
    		<li> Fixed an issue where the app failed to connect to the update server
    		<li> Added inspector icons.
    	    <li> Fixed minor side bar issues
    	</ul>	    
    	<li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 171:
    	<ul>
    		<li> Fixed an issue that caused the app to crash when loading a project containing 
    			 spectra with identified bulges
    		<li> Fixed multiple race conditions that caused the app to crash when starting
    			 with multiple open projects.
    	    <li> Improved code stability
    	</ul>	
        <li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 170:
    	<ul>
    		<li> New Sidebar.
    		<li> New design of the project setup UI. Project ressources such as the 
    		     spectrum template are now selected via the setup UI.
    		<li> Progress reports when computing a sum spectrum.
    		<li> Migrated code to Swift 4.2, xCode 10.0
    		<li> Removed obsolete code.
    		<li> Fixed an issue where spectrum plots do not correctly show faint features.
    		<li> Fixed an issue where the sum spectrum is not shown after computing.
    	</ul>    	
    	<li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 165:
    	<ul>
    		<li> Models can be fitted to auxiliary waveforms.
    		<li> Greatly improved line assignments.
    		<li> Added missing capabilities from the IDL version.
    		<li> And last but not least a mother lode of bug fixes.
    	</ul>    	
        <li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 145:
    	<ul>
    		<li> The app architecture is now document based. This allows to have more than
    			one spectrum project opened.
    		<li> Each opened spectrum project employs its own set of libraries and 
    			spectrometers.
    		<li> Newly imported data sets are created as new projects, while the current
    			project remains open.
    		<li> Note that because of the architecture of the Spice toolkit all 
    			open projects use the same spice setup.
    	</ul>
    </ul>
