            <li> Line shape view has now the same look and feel as the spectrum viewer    
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li> Sum spectrum viewer has now the same look and feel as the spectrum viewer
            <li> Sidebar and correlation panel can be alternatively selected via the context menu
            <li> Trackpad provides haptic response when moving the mouse across the spectrum 
            <li> Clipped lines are now marked red

        </ul>
    	<li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 177:
    	<ul>
    		<li> Replaced Sparkle updater. Autoupdate should not stall any longer.

    		     containing ALL KERNELS needs to be identified first via the preferences 
    		     dialog.
    		<li> The side bar presents Spice based event parameters.
    	    <li> Fixed a couple of bugs related to very old projects and to CDA data.   
    	</ul>	    
    	<li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 172:
    	<ul>
    		<li> Fixed an issue where the app failed to connect to the update server

    	<ul>
    		<li> Fixed an issue that caused the app to crash when loading a project containing 
    			 spectra with identified bulges
    		<li> Fixed multiple race conditions that caused the app to crash when starting
    			 with multiple open projects.
    	    <li> Improved code stability
    	</ul>	
        <li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 170:
    	<ul>
    		<li> New Sidebar.
    		<li> New design of the project setup UI. Project ressources such as the 
    		     spectrum template are now selected via the setup UI.
    		<li> Progress reports when computing a sum spectrum.
    		<li> Migrated code to Swift 4.2, xCode 10.0
    		<li> Removed obsolete code.
    		<li> Fixed an issue where spectrum plots do not correctly show faint features.
    		<li> Fixed an issue where the sum spectrum is not shown after computing.
    	</ul>    	
    	<li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 165:
    	<ul>
    		<li> Models can be fitted to auxiliary waveforms.

    		<li> Added missing capabilities from the IDL version.
    		<li> And last but not least a mother lode of bug fixes.

        <li> Version 1.7.0 Nightly Build 145:
    	<ul>
    		<li> The app architecture is now document based. This allows to have more than
    			one spectrum project opened.
    		<li> Each opened spectrum project employs its own set of libraries and 
    			spectrometers.
    		<li> Newly imported data sets are created as new projects, while the current
    			project remains open.
    		<li> Note that because of the architecture of the Spice toolkit all 
    			open projects use the same spice setup.
    	</ul>
    </ul>
