	<ul>
	  <li> Version 2.1 Nightly Build 211:
	    <ul>
	        <li> More powerful data filters. Now conditions such as line area limits or fitting status can be applied to individual lines. 
	        <li> Spectrum documents have an icon.
            <li> UI improvements. 
	        <li> Crashed even more bugs.
        </ul>	
	    <li> Version 2.1 Nightly Build 207:
	    <ul>
	        <li> Added new line shape functsions and improved reliability of fits.
            <li> UI improvements.
	        <li> Crashed even more bugs.
        </ul>					
	    <li> Version 2.1 Nightly Build 204:
	    <ul>
	        <li> Strongly improved fitting of lines and line clusters.
	        <li> Derives line areas, isotopic abundances, ion ratios, and ion fraction.
	        <li> Abundance Statistics.
            <li> UI improvements.
	        <li> Last but not least many bug fixes.
        </ul>				
	    <li> Version 2.1 Nightly Build 201:
	    <ul>
	        <li> Supports more appropriate line profile functions
	        <li> Accurate determination of the line's area
	        <li> Ion ratios can be based on line areas rather than on line amplitudes
            <li> Fix possible crashes.
        </ul>			
	    <li> Version 2.1 Nightly Build 195:
	    <ul>
	        <li> Ion ratios statistics tool can identify data clusters
	        <li> New menu for changing the mass range of line profiles 
	        <li> Fix layout constraints 
	        <li> Fix the presentation of the upper axis of line profile plots
	        <li> Fix an issue where the side bar inspectors are not updated appropriately
	        <li> Fix an issue where touch bar buttons are not updated in a timely fashion
            <li> Fix possible crashes.
