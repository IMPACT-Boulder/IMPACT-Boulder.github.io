<title>Version 3.1.0 (Build 397)</title>
<description>
	This is a beta version which probably has not been sufficiently tested.
	<ul>	    
			<li> Version 3.1.0 (Build 397):
			<ul>
					<li> Fixes an issue where sometimes the cursor was not any longer responding to mouse movements.
					<li> Fixes some menu items in the main menu.
					<li> Rewrote data viewer code to increase stability.
					<li> Other bug fixes. 
			</ul>
		<li> Version 3.1.0 (Build 395):
			<ul>
					<li> Queries of large data sets are now much faster.
					<li> The number of bins to compute the composition statistics can now be set by the user.
					<li> Rewrote data viewer code to increase stability.
					<li> Fixes an issue that prevented the line drop down menu in the Spectrum Tab's line table to be updated.
					<li>  Multiple bug fixes. 
			</ul>
		<li> Version 3.1.0 (Build 394):
			<ul>
					<li> Data sets can now be quality marked in the Project/General dialog.
					<li> Supports Impact database version 3.4.0, which now accepts QD (accelerator) data.
					<li> Ignored and locked state of mass lines are now exported to Impact DB. 
	    			<li> H5 imports and exports now include QD (accelerator) data
	    			<li> Anchor lines are now correctly loaded from Impact DB.
	    			<li> Fixes an issue where CDA data sets could not be merged.
	    	</ul>
		<li> Version 3.1.0 (Build 393):
			<ul>
	    			<li> This version brings support of user-defined Python functions. Right now Python modules computing line shapes and waveform models can be called by Spectrum. Python plugins need to registered via the Preferences dialog. Because Spectrum is sandboxed, it cannot call call external programs including the Python interpreter. For this reason, a full Python 3.8 package including NumPy is bundled into the App (which explains the large increase of the app's size).
	    			<li> The H5 import and export capabilities have been further improved. H5 archives starting with a LILBID group are considered to contain LILBID raw data generated by the Freie University group and will be coverted into a Spectrum project.
	    			<li> This version now imports CCSDS packet data generated by SUDA FSW version 9.
	    			<li> Impproved import of PSU data. The correlation between PSU and QD data can be analysed indepth with the new QD Detection Statistics tool.
	    			<li> New tool for visualizing the impact plasma composition as function of the impact speed, impact energy, and impact energy density.
	    			<li> Improved Impact database import and export.
	    			<li> Multiple bug fixes. 
	   		</ul>
	    <li> Version 3.1.0 (Build 388):
	    	<ul>
	    			<li> New Impact Database account management, which moved to the Preferences dialog. 
	    				   Account credentials will be stored in the user's local keychain, implying that passwords
	    				   only need entered at the time of the account's registration with the app. Accounts can 
	    				   be selected in the main menu's Impact menu.
	    		    <li> Impact Database action menus have been moved to stand alone menu Impact located 
	    		           in the main menu bar.
	    		    <li> The H5 export has been significantly enhanced to allow for the reimport of H5 files. Import 
	    		           of H5 Spectrum archives are now possible.
	    		    <li> Major parts of the app's code base have been moved to external packages to improve 
	    		           the quality and testability of the software.
	    		    <li> Many minor improvenments and bug fixes.
	    	</ul>
	</ul>
