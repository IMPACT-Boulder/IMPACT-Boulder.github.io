				<h1>About LunGradCon</h1>


				<p>
				The 15<sup>th</sup> annual Lunar and Small Bodies Graduate Forum (LunGradCon 2024) will be held in-person on July 22<sup>nd</sup> at <a href="https://sservi.nasa.gov/nesf2024/" target="_blank">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. Light food and refreshments will be provided at the beginning of the day.
				</p>

				<p>LunGradCon 2023 intended to enhance the professional development of graduate students in lunar science by providing an opportunity to present and discuss scientific research in an environment of their peers. As such, the conference was both planned by and restricted to current graduate students.
				</p>
			

				<p>
				Following the broad interests of the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the scope of LunGradCon includes both lunar and small body science. LunGradCon provides an opportunity for grad students and early-career postdocs to present their research on lunar and small body science in a low-stress, friendly environment, being critiqued only by their student and recent graduate peers. In addition to pre-recorded oral presentations, the forum presents opportunities for professional development and networking with fellow grad students and postdocs, as well as senior members of SSERVI.</p>
				<p>
				LunGradCon will address the following research topics of the <a href="https://sservi.nasa.gov" target="_blank">NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute</a>:
				</p>
				<ul style="list-style:disc">
					<li><b>Dust/Regolith and Plasma</b></li>
					<li><b>Geology and Geophysics</b></li>
					<li><b>Volatiles/Exospheres</b></li>
					<li><b>Missions and Human Exploration</b></li>
				</ul>
				<P>The LunGradCon speaker schedule will be announced soon.</P>
			<!--<p>LunGradCon will also present opportunities for social networking among LGC participants and senior scientists and engineers from NASA ARC and the NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute.</p>-->
