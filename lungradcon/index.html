<p>
Following the broad interests of the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the scope of LunGradCon includes both lunar and small body science. LunGradCon provides an opportunity for grad students and early-career postdocs to present their research on lunar and small body science in a low-stress, friendly environment, being critiqued only by their student and recent graduate peers. In addition to pre-recorded oral presentations, the forum presents opportunities for professional development and networking with fellow grad students and postdocs, as well as senior members of SSERVI.</p>
<p>
LunGradCon will address the following research topics of the <a href="https://sservi.nasa.gov">NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute</a>:
</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc">
	<li><b>Dust/Regolith and Plasma</b></li>
	<li><b>Geology and Geophysics</b></li>
	<li><b>Volatiles/Exospheres</b></li>
	<li><b>Missions and Human Exploration</b></li>
</ul>

<!--<p>LunGradCon will also present opportunities for social networking among LGC participants and senior scientists and engineers from NASA ARC and the NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute.</p>-->
