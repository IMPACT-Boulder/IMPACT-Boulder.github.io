                <li> As default only Thrace and Thera Macula and Chaos North and South are selected
                     as unique geologic regions. The regions default setup is Type A: 5%, Type B: 5%,

            </ul>  
        <li> Version 1.10.0 (Build 40):
            <ul>
                <li> The kernels of the default tour(s) are not any longer bundled with the app, but will be installed
                     when launching the app.
                <li> Added sub-baseline tour candidate S2V7. 
                <li> Added fallback to a strict nadir tracking S/C attitude profile for flybys without CK coverage 
                     (there is no CK for S2S7 yet.).
                <li> Experimental: It is now possible to simultanously work with tours with different Spice setups.
                <li> Bug fixes.
            </ul>  
        <li> Version 1.9.0 (Build 39):
            <ul>
                <li> Improves the setup of Spice kernels to load. You can now either load the kernels using
					 meta kernel, or you can select individual kernels via a user interface.
                <li> Adds the ability to show the MC rates of ejecta emitted from features and from the background.
                <li> Bug fixes.
            </ul>  
        <li> Version 1.8.0 (Build 37):
            <ul>
                <li> Improved geologic landforms editor. Landforms can be renamed.

                <li> Flyby sidebar lists number of ejecta emitted from landform.
                <li> Bug fixes.
            </ul>  
        <li> Version 1.7.1 (Build 36):
            <ul>
                <li> Reduced app size: The surface maps are not any longer bundled with the app but will 
                     be loaded from the server.
                <li> Code base is now compliant with xCode 16 and Swift 6.
            </ul>  
        <li> Version 1.7.0 (Build 35):
            <ul>

            <li> Can be run without any external Spice ressources. To this aim unselect
                 "Spice data is loaded from user-defined directory". In this configuration
                 the app uses the 21F31V6 tour kernels, which are bundled with the app.
            <li> Improved import of tour simulations.

            <ul>
                <li> Reduced app size: The surface maps are not any longer bundled with the app but will 
                     be loaded from the server.
                <li> Code base is now compliant with xCode 16 and Swift 6.
            </ul>  
        <li> Version 1.7.0 (Build 35):
            <ul>
                <li> Monte Carlo simulations of SUDA flybys.
                <li> Marks launch and detection sites.
                <li> Landforms can now be downselected.
            </ul>  
        <li> Version 1.6.0 (Build 34):
            <ul>
                <li> Added Cruise pannel:
                <ul>
                    <li> Added cruise CK to app bundle.
                    <li> IDP model by Divine for estimating dust count.
                    <li> Pointing models for IDPs, ISD, and Jovian nanograins.
                </ul>
                <li> Added splash screen (experimental).
                <li> Added roadmap.
                <li> Performance improvements.
            </ul>  
        <li> Version 1.4.0 (Build 32):
        <ul>
            <li> Shows ground tracks.
            <li> Marks landforms on surface maps.
            <li> Added dialog for importing KML encoded landform definitions. 
        </ul>  
        <li> Version 1.2.1 (Build 30):     
        <ul>
            <li> Can be run without any external Spice ressources. To this aim unselect
                 "Spice data is loaded from user-defined directory". In this configuration
                 the app uses the 21F31V6 tour kernels, which are bundled with the app.
            <li> Improved import of tour simulations.
            <li> Improved requirement verification.
            <li> Many bug fixes and improvements.
        </ul>  
        <li> Version 1.1.0 (Build 28):     
        <ul>
            <li> Migrated orbit, time line, ring survey, and nanograin viewers.
            <li> Analyses orbits, identifies ring and nanograins survey opportunities.
		</ul>
     	<li> Version 1.0.1 (Build 26): 
   		<ul>
            <li> Identifies flybys on Jovian moons based on Europa Clipper kernels.
            <li> Analyses flybys, predicts impact rates, and identifies health and safety issues.
		</ul>	
    </ul>
