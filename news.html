            <section class="news_content_horz">
                    <section class="news_p">
                        <p>NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has unveiled new insights into the potential expansion of the Kuiper Belt, challenging previous estimations. Recent data from the Student Dust Counter (SDC) instrument, developed by students at the University of Colorado Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP), indicates unexpectedly high levels of dust, disrupting existing scientific models and suggesting a broader Kuiper Belt than previously believed. These discoveries, detailed in a recent Astrophysical Journal Letters publication, signify a notable advancement in our comprehension of the solar system's outer limits. Lead author <a href="http://impact.colorado.edu/people.html#doner">Alex Doner</a>, a physics graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, emphasizes the significance of these direct measurements of interplanetary dust beyond Neptune and Pluto's orbit. Since New Horizons launched in 2006, the onboard instruments have made a number of significant measurements, including landmark encounters with Pluto in 2015 and the Kuiper Belt object Arrokoth in 2019. The unexpected findings align with recent telescopic observations indicating Kuiper Belt objects beyond previously identified boundaries. As scientists continue analyzing the data, potential explanations for the heightened dust levels, such as radiation pressure or previously unaccounted-for ice particles, are under consideration. With the New Horizons mission expected to extend into the 2040s, further revelations about the Kuiper Belt's composition and reach are anticipated, offering unprecedented insights into the dynamics of our solar system's outer regions.

              <section class="news_p">
                  <p>EDA was funded by NASA's Development and Advancement of Lunar Instrumentation (DALI) program and has undergone a series of developments and tests, and successfully achieved Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 in early 2023. EDA as part of an instrument suite proposed at Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) is now competing for NASA's Artemis III crewed mission to the lunar south polar region. If selected, it will be expected to be launched in December 2025</p>
                  <p>Electrostatic Dust Analyzer (EDA) developed at NASA SSERVI's IMPACT is a dedicated instrument to unambiguously answer a more than five-decade old question about electrostatic dust lofting on the lunar surface, which was first indicated from observations by several NASA's Surveyor spacecraft in late 1960's, the so-called Lunar Horizon Glow. Understanding this electrostatic process on the lunar surface addresses important issues on dust hazards and their mitigation for future long-term, sustainable human and robotic exploration to the surface of the Moon. In addition, measurements by EDA on the lunar surface will greatly advance our understanding of electrostatic dust lofting and its effects on surface processes on all airless bodies in the solar system. </p>

                    <p>NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission is coming to an end and will impact the lunar surface later this week. Launched in September 2013, LADEE has been exploring the moon's dusty atmosphere trying to unravel mysteries like horizon glow observed by the Apollo missions. <a href="people.html#horanyi">Mih&aacute;ly Hor&aacute;nyi</a> is the PI of LADEE's Lunar Dust Environment EXplorer (LDEX), which has been collecting dust to characterize both the tenous atmosphere and surface processes.</p>
